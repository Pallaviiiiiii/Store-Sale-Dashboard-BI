# Store-Sale-Dashboard-BI

This visualization project aims to Analyse a fictitious superstore’s sales performance between 2016 and 2019 using Microsoft Power BI.

The three key steps involved in this project include:
1. Data Collection
2. Data Preparation/Cleaning
3. Analysis and Visualization

## Data Collection
Data collection is the process of gathering and analyzing data from various sources to answer questions, evaluate outcomes, and forecast trends. It's an essential step in research, analysis, and decision-making in many fields

## Data Preparation/Cleaning
The Data Cleaning involved tasks like handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting data types, and addressing inconsistencies in columns, ensuring a more accurate and usable dataset for analysis. This phase enabled me to improve the quality of data, and have better insights and decision-making from the Sample Super Store Dataset.

## Analysis and Visualization
As I mentioned before the goal of this project is to carry out a sales performance analysis for the store. A sales performance analysis should answer the following questions:

•	What are the total sales accrued by the states?
•	What is the revenue accrued annually by the states?
•	What is the average revenue accrued by the states?
•	Which category generates the most revenue for the country?
•	What Region, Category, and Segment yields more revenue at different periods?


# Sections in the Report:
 
•	Report has Multiple Section's from where you can manage the Data, Like :
•	Report Data can be sliced by Quarter of Year to show Data of Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4.
•	Report Data can also be sliced by State to show sales of any particular State.
•	It has cards showing Total Amount, Total Profit, Total Quantity of Sale.
•	Report has a Bar Chart showing Total Profit by Month.
•	I conditionally formatted the Bar Chart to show different color when there is loss in Business.
•	Report has another Horizontal Bar Chart which shows Profit by Sub Category of Items.
•	Then I have included a Donut Chart to show how much Quantity of Product is order through which Payment Mode.
•	I also included a Donut Chart to show how much Quantity of Product is ordered in which Category.
